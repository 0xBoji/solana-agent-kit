  description: "Execute a cross-chain bridge transaction on Solana. ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This is a critical operation that will move your tokens between chains - always get user confirmation before proceeding. This is the final step in the bridging process after getting a quote and creating an order. The transaction data must be obtained from CREATE_BRIDGE_ORDER first. Follow these steps:\n1. Use GET_SUPPORTED_CHAINS to find chain IDs\n2. Use GET_TOKENS_INFO to get token addresses\n3. Use GET_BRIDGE_QUOTE to estimate fees and amounts\n4. Use CREATE_BRIDGE_ORDER to prepare the transaction\n5. Get explicit user confirmation to proceed\n6. Finally, use this command to execute the prepared transaction\n\nExample:\nEXECUTE_BRIDGE_ORDER { \"transactionData\": \"0x123...\" }",
